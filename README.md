<h2 align="center">Cricket Dashboard and World Cup Prediction</h2>


Cricket is a very popular game played between 2 Teams each comprising of 11 players which includes Batsmen and Bowlers. The Batting side tries to score as many runs it can while while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this and dismiss each batter.There are quite a few formats ranging from an ODI, played for a single innings of 50 overs, Twenty20, played for a single innings of 20 overs, to Test matches, played over five days with unlimited overs and the teams each batting for two innings of unlimited length.

In This project, I have created a Dashboard using Dash with Plotly. Dash is ideal for building data visualization apps with highly custom user interfaces in pure Python. It's particularly suited for anyone who works with data in Python. In the Dashoboard, there are 2 main tabs, one for the Teams and the other one for Players. Under the Tab Team, there is information regarding the No. of Matches Won by a Team, Lost and their Win ratio. Under the Players Tab, there are two sub-divsions-one for Batsman and one for Bowler. For the Batsman, we have the information for the number of runs scored, the Strike rate and also the Batting Trend. Similarly, under the Bowlers Tab, we have information about the wickets taken, the economy and the Bowling Trend for the player.
